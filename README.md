# Data Analysis Daily 

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to Data Analysis Projects! This is a space where I engage in daily exploration 
and application of data analysis concepts.
*The aim is to engage in different data analysis concepts with the goal of daily learning and growth, and to gain proficiency in all concepts.*
Below you'll find a brief overview of each project, outlining its purpose and the key skills or tools utilized. For more detailed information, please visit the respective project folders.

**Challenge_1 Retail Analysis** 📊💻📈

I used a randomly generated dataset with the aim to get hands-on exposure to the data analysis workflow. 
This project involved cleaning and analyzing retail data using Python (**Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, SQLAlchemy**)
and SQL, focusing on inventory management and sales trend analysis. Skills developed include data preprocessing, 
SQL querying for advanced analysis, and statistical methods like **linear regression** for interpreting sales trends and optimizing inventory.

**Challenge_2 Correlation Python** 🔍📉🔢
My aim in this project was to learn and practice  correlation. I cleaned missing data, duplicates, data types
and used scatterplot to visualize correlation between numerical data also created a heatmap for a correlation
matrix.I further studied correlation significance by learning how to use the t-test, specifically understanding t-values and p-values.


### Technologies and Tools
