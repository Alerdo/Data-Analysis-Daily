# Data Analysis Daily 

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to Data Analysis Projects! This is a space where I explore and apply data analysis concepts daily, aiming for continual learning and mastery. Below is a quick overview of each project, highlighting its purpose and the main skills or tools used. For in-depth details, please check the project folders.

**Challenge_1 Retail Analysis** 📊💻📈

I used a randomly generated dataset with the aim to get hands-on exposure to the data analysis workflow. 
This project involved cleaning and analyzing retail data using Python (**Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, SQLAlchemy**)
and SQL, focusing on inventory management and sales trend analysis. Skills developed include data preprocessing, 
SQL querying for advanced analysis, and statistical methods like **linear regression** for interpreting sales trends and optimizing inventory.

**Challenge_2 Correlation Python** 🔍📉🔢
My aim in this project was to learn and practice  correlation. I cleaned missing data, duplicates, data types
and used **scatterplots** to visualize correlation between numerical data also created a **heatmap** for a correlation
matrix. I further studied **correlation significance** by learning how to use the **t-test**, specifically understanding **t-values** and **p-values**.


### Technologies and Tools

Throughout these projects, I utilize a range of technologies and tools, such as:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sqlalchemy
- SciPy 
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks
